    My foundation was built at BMS Institute of Technology in Bangalore, 
    where I earned my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
    During this time, I developed a strong understanding of neural networks,
    artificial intelligence, and digital image processing. My undergraduate 
    coursework and projects in adaptive image processing using technologies
    like GoogleNet and CLAHE laid the groundwork for my current specialization
    in deep learning and computer vision.
