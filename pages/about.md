# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
ML Engineer and AI Researcher specializing in transforming complex research concepts into scalable, production-ready solutions. 

My expertise spans:
   * Medical Imaging: Creating diffusion models for improved diagnostic visualization
   * Molecular Modeling: Implementing graph neural networks for property prediction
   * Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Building systems for more reliable AI

I bring a methodical approach to problem-solving, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation. I'm particularly fascinated by making large language models more reliable through techniques like retrieval augmentation and structured knowledge representation.
My passion lies in building AI systems that are not just intelligent but also interpretable, ethical, and aligned with human needs. I'm seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in deep learning and MLOps to solve meaningful problems in healthcare, scientific research, or enterprise systems.
