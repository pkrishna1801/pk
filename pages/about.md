# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm Prarthana Krishnamurthy, a Machine Learning Engineer and AI Researcher pursuing my M.S. in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University. With a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I've evolved into a passionate AI practitioner who thrives at the intersection of cutting-edge research and practical implementation.
My journey in deep learning has led me to develop expertise in medical imaging, molecular modeling, and retrieval-augmented generation systems. I specialize in building end-to-end machine learning pipelines that transform complex research concepts into scalable, production-ready solutions.
As a former Data Engineer at Societe Generale, I automated data pipelines and developed monitoring systems that empowered business analysts to gain insights without engineering support. This experience taught me the value of creating AI systems that are not only technically advanced but also accessible and user-friendly.
My recent work focuses on advancing healthcare AI through diffusion models for MRI synthesis, fine-tuning language models for scientific knowledge extraction, and creating agentic systems for process automation. I'm particularly fascinated by the challenge of making large language models more reliable through techniques like retrieval augmentation and structured knowledge representation.
Beyond technical skills, I bring a methodical approach to problem-solving, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation. I believe in building AI systems that are not just intelligent but also interpretable, ethical, and aligned with human needs.
I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise in deep learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and MLOps to solve meaningful problems in healthcare, scientific research, or enterprise AI systems.
